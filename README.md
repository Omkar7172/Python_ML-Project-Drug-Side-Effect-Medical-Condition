Objective- The goal is to analyze the relationships between drugs, their side effects, and the medical conditions they treat, as well as to explore the ratings and reviews associated with these drugs.

Dataset Overview- The dataset contains the following columns: ● drug_name: Name of the drug. ● medical_condition: The condition the drug is used to treat. ● side_effects: Common side effects of the drug. ● generic_name: The generic name of the drug. ● drug_classes: The class of the drug (e.g., antibiotic, antihistamine). ● brand_names: Brand names under which the drug is sold. ● activity: The activity of the drug (e.g., active, inactive). ● rx_otc: Indicates if the drug is prescription (Rx) or over-the-counter (OTC). ● pregnancy_category: The drug's pregnancy risk category. ● csa: Controlled Substances Act schedule, if applicable. ● alcohol: Interactions with alcohol. ● related_drugs: Other drugs related to the primary drug. ● medical_condition_description: A brief description of the medical condition. ● rating: Average user rating of the drug. ● no_of_reviews: Number of user reviews. ● drug_link: URL link to more information about the drug. ● medical_condition_url: URL link to more information about the medical condition.
Tools Required- ● Python: The primary programming language for data analysis. ● Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis. ● Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization. ● Jupyter Notebook: To write and run Python code.
Step-by-Step Guide-Step 1: Import Libraries import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns Step 2: Load the Dataset Load your dataset df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv') Display the first few rows of the dataset df.head() Step 3: Data Cleaning ● Check for missing values: Check for missing values df.isnull().sum() ● Handle missing values: ○ Drop or fill missing values depending on the context. Example: Drop rows with missing values df_cleaned = df.dropna() Or fill missing values with a placeholder df_filled = df.fillna('Unknown')
Step 4: Basic Data Exploration ● Summary statistics: Summary statistics df.describe() ● Distribution of Ratings: Distribution of drug ratings plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) sns.histplot(df['rating'], bins=10, kde=True) plt.title('Distribution of Drug Ratings') plt.xlabel('Rating') plt.ylabel('Frequency') plt.show()
Step 5: Analyzing Relationships ● Top Drugs by Condition: Count the most common drugs for each medical condition top_drugs = df.groupby('medical_condition')['drug_name'].value_counts().nla rgest(10) print(top_drugs) ● Side Effects Analysis: Analyzing the most common side effects side_effects = df['side_effects'].value_counts().head(10) print(side_effects) ● Drug Ratings by Class: Boxplot of ratings by drug class plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8)) sns.boxplot(x='drug_classes', y='rating', data=df) plt.xticks(rotation=90) plt.title('Drug Ratings by Class') plt.show()
Step 6: Conclusion ● Summarize findings: ○ Identify any trends or patterns in the data. ○ Discuss how certain drug classes or conditions are associated with specific side effects or ratings. 5. Next Steps ● Advanced Analysis: Perform more sophisticated statistical tests or machine learning techniques. ● Reporting: Create a report or presentation to share the findings. 6. Example Output ● Distribution of Drug Ratings: ○ A histogram showing how drug ratings are distributed, with peaks at certain rating values. ● Top Drugs for a Condition: ○ A list or bar chart showing the most commonly prescribed drugs for a particular condition. ● Side Effects Analysis: ○ A list of the most common side effects reported in the dataset.
